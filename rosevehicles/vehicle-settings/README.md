## **Vehicle Title**

All vehicles have a unique "vehicle title" in config. It is the name at the top of the file, like:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/vehicle_title.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In the image above, the vehicle title is "volga". To get the item in your server, use /rv give vehicles:volga

{% hint style="warning" %}
The names of files are completely ignored. We suggest matching them with your vehicle title (e.g., `volga.yml`), but this is optional and does not affect the plugin.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Your vehicle title (And ALL OTHER config options) should **never** use any character other then a->z, A->Z, 0->9, and underscores `_`. Do NOT use periods or dashes.
{% endhint %}

## Sections (Modules)

All vehicles use modules. A "Module" is a fancy way of saying a section in your config. For example, the **Movement** module is required for all weapons. It goes under your vehicle name in the config with 2 spaces. Let's look at an example of the `volga`:

```yaml
volga:
  Movement:
    # Other options go here, like Lock_Camera, Physics, Wheels and Events
```

Most modules can also have sections inside. For example:

```yaml
Movement:
  Lock_The_Camera:
    Enable: true
    # Other options go here, like Seats and Interpolation
```
